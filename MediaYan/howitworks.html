          <h5>How It Works</h5><br><br>
          <p>Now, how does Media Yan track all this stuff about you? Simple. We have the connections with companies everyone is familiar with. Your phone company, your internet provider, your government and many other distinguished organizations. Our technology is made by the best of the best and the information we get is gathered by some of our finest secret agents.<br><br></p>
          <img src="images/spy.png" alt="">
          <p> <br>Our agents have your best interest at heart and are sworn to their life of secrecy. They are trained information brokers and legalized by the US. Our service only requires that you sign up!<br><br></p>

          <h5>Other Great Features You Should Know About</h5><br><br>

          <p>One of our main features is that you can customize each category. For example, if you never read books, you can go the Settings Link in the bottom navigation bar and you can unselect the Books category under print so it does not appear on your MY (Media Yan) pages. After that, you can simply save changes.<br> 
            Another great thing about Media Yan is that it not only tracks where you go and what media you are using, it records how much time you spend on it and what date you accessed it.<br><br>

            Lastly, Media Yan has a lock screen. This is set to on when you first sign up to prevent anyone from looking at your account. The lock screen activates after 10 minutes and censors your pages. The lock screen will not let you back in till you re-type your password in the box below it. However, if you find this tedious, you always have the option of deactivating it from your settings page.<br><br>Have Fun :)<br></p>
