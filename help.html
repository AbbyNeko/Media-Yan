        <p><b>How do I sign up?</b><br> There is a sign up button on the homepage. We just ask for your name, email, mobile number and a password for your account. Then, for Media Yan to work, we require an installion of a browser extension and then, you're all set!<br><br>
          <b>How can I contact customer service if I have any issues?</b><br>
          Go to the Contact page and you will find the customer service number there.<br><br>
          <b>I'm concerned about the privacy of my account information. What features do you offer to keep my information safe?</b><br>
          If you look at the How It Works page, it will explain our key security features and tips for keeping safe on our site. If for any reason, you feel you information has been compromised, close down your account and that information should be instantly terminated upon deletion of your account, no matter who has it.<br><br>
          <b>How does Media Yan get information about the media I consume? That sounds scary. Does it do something to my computer?</b><br>
          When you sign up for Media Yan, you are required to install a browser extension that allows us to look at your tracking cookies and write information about where you have been and your activity. For other media, we partner with other companies and they stream information to us about your activity BUT only if you signed up for an account and agreed to our terms of use. As for the print media, we actually send spies for recording all your activity with print media. Our special stalkers are best in the business and very private.
